# Lower-Limb Adaptive State Estimation EKF




This repo is to track the work that I am doing in collaboration with the [Locomotor Control Systems Laboratory](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/locolab/) under Prof. Robert Gregg and Gray Cortright 

This project is meant to encapsulate the Kronecker Model Fitting process, personalization map calculation and EKF implementation.

There are additional scripts to standardize datasets into python-friendly parquet fies which are readable with python.
